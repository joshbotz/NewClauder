# Starter prompts — by role

A handout for users finishing the tour. When the user reaches the 5-minute exit ritual, extract the 10 prompts for their role from this file, write them to `~/Documents/newclauder-starter-prompts.md`, tell them the full path, and offer to open it.

These are written in the user's voice — what they would type to Claude Code — not in Claude's voice. The point is to remove "what do I even ask for?" friction the day after the tour.

**Safety-conscious tip baked into several prompts:** when working with potentially untrusted content (logs from unknown sources, files received via email, web pages), suggest the user start in plan mode (`/permissions`) so nothing executes automatically.

## SOC / security ops

1. "Here's a phishing email — full headers and body pasted below. Triage it: verdict, IOCs, why it's suspicious, what to tell the reporter. Start in plan mode."
2. "Decode this base64 PowerShell blob without running it (plan mode). Walk me through what it would do, flag the malicious bits, save your analysis to a file."
3. "Read every Zeek log in this folder and rank source IPs by suspicion. Output a CSV I can hand to triage."
4. "Draft a Sigma rule, a Splunk SPL, and a KQL version for this CVE. Lint them against any existing rules in `./rules/`."
5. "Turn my IR runbook into a checklist for a specific scenario: ransomware on one endpoint, after-hours, single analyst on shift."
6. "Tail this log file and tell me what looks weird. Don't just describe it — call out specific lines."
7. "Convert this messy Excel of alert exports into a clean markdown table grouped by severity."
8. "Read these three threat-intel PDFs and produce one consolidated brief: campaign, TTPs mapped to MITRE, IOCs as a table."
9. "Write me a triage rubric for benign-looking outbound DNS to newly-registered domains. What's the deciding question?"
10. "Build me a `CLAUDE.md` for this folder that says 'this contains synthetic data only, default to plan mode.'"

## GRC / compliance

1. "Here's an auditor's findings PDF. Turn it into a remediation tracker: control, owner, severity, due date, evidence needed."

5. "Sanitize this incident write-up for a SOC 2 disclosure. Strip identifiers, preserve the timeline."
6. "Read these three SOC 2 reports and compare their control coverage side by side."
7. "Take this risk register and re-sort it by residual risk, not inherent risk. Same columns, different order."
8. "Draft a one-page exec summary of our quarterly compliance posture from this evidence folder."
9. "Convert this regulatory text into a checklist of obligations we'd need to meet. Plain English."
10. "Help me write a CLAUDE.md for our compliance folder so future sessions know our naming conventions and what frameworks we care about."

2. "Convert this curl command (from Burp) into a clean Python requests script with auth handling and a TODO for the param I want to fuzz."
3. "Read this CVE PoC on GitHub. Explain how the bug works in 5 sentences. Sketch a safe lab repro using Docker."
4. "Rewrite the exec summary of this pentest report in client-readable English. Don't lose the technical accuracy."

6. "Generate me a wordlist tuned to this target's tech stack. Save to a file."
7. "Read this engagement scope doc and tell me what's *out* of scope I might miss in the rush."
8. "Help me write a retesting checklist for the findings we shipped last quarter."
